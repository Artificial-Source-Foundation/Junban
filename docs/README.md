# Vision & Design

## What is ASF?

[AI Strategic Forum (ASF)](https://github.com/asf-org) is a community for AI enthusiasts focused on curated news, long-form analysis, and open-source tools. ASF values accuracy over speed, sources over vibes, and transparency over persuasion.

## What is Saydo?

A task manager that fills a gap: no good open-source option combines a clean UI, real AI integration, a plugin system, and full data ownership.

| Existing tool | Where it falls short |
|---|---|
| Todoist / TickTick | Closed source, weak AI, no extensibility, your data in their cloud |
| Obsidian Tasks | Notes app with tasks bolted on, not a task manager |
| Taskwarrior | Terminal-only, steep learning curve |
| Vikunja / Planka | No plugins, no AI |

Saydo is minimal out of the box. The plugin system is how you add what you need — and it's designed so anyone can ask an AI to generate a working plugin.

## Design principles

### Local-first, private by default

Data lives on your machine. Zero network calls by default. No accounts, no telemetry. AI features require your own API keys going directly to your provider — or run fully local with Ollama.

### AI-native, not bolted on

The AI assistant is a core part of the design — conversational sidebar, voice input, task context awareness. But it's completely optional. The app works fine without it.

### Vibe-code extensible

The plugin API is designed so that describing what you want to Claude or ChatGPT produces a working plugin. If the API is too complicated for AI to generate correct code, it's too complicated.

Inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Pi's extension model](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).

### Minimal by default

Clean UI, no feature bloat. A developer wants Git sync and keyboard shortcuts. A PM wants Kanban. A student wants Pomodoro. The core doesn't pick sides — plugins do.

### No vendor lock-in

SQLite or Markdown files. Export anytime (JSON, CSV, Markdown). Switching away should be trivial. MIT licensed.

### Honest business model

Free forever. Revenue from optional paid sync hosting (like Obsidian Sync), not dark patterns or artificial limitations.

## Platform strategy

| Phase | Platform | Status |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | Desktop (Mac, Windows, Linux via Tauri) | Shipped |
| v1.5 | Cross-device sync service | Planned |
| v2 | Mobile (native + PWA) | Planned (needs sync) |
| v3 | Web app | Planned (needs sync) |

## Business model

| Tier | Price | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Saydo | Free | Full app, all features, all plugins, local storage |
| Saydo Sync | Paid (TBD) | ASF-hosted sync for cross-device access |
| Saydo Enterprise | Paid (future) | Team features, admin controls, SSO |

The core app will never be paywalled.

## Plugin ecosystem

A community plugin store (like Obsidian's) where plugins are reviewed by ASF maintainers for safety before listing. Anyone can build plugins:

- **Developers**: write TypeScript, use the full Plugin API
- **Everyone else**: describe what you want to an AI, get a working plugin back

See [Plugin API](plugins/API.md) for the reference and [examples](plugins/EXAMPLES.md) for walkthroughs.

## ASF values

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Accuracy > Speed | Get it right, not just first |
| Disclosure > Persuasion | Be transparent about biases and limitations |
| Sources > Vibes | Cite, link, verify |
| Label speculation | If it's a guess, say so |
| No hidden promotion | Disclose affiliations |
