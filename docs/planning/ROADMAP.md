- **Habit tracker plugin** — recurring habit tracking with streaks
- **Discord reminder plugin** — task reminders via Discord bot
- **Google Calendar plugin** — two-way sync with Google Calendar
- **Focus mode** — hide everything except the current task
- **Team sync** — shared projects with conflict resolution
- **Webhooks plugin** — trigger external services on task events
- **Email-to-task plugin** — create tasks by forwarding emails
