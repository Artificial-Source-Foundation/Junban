# Sprints

Two-week sprint cycles. Each sprint has a clear goal and pulls items from the [Backlog](BACKLOG.md).

## How Sprints Work

- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Planning**: Select items from backlog at sprint start, assign to sprint column in BACKLOG.md
- **Daily work**: Pick the next `ready` item, mark `in-progress`, complete it
- **Review**: At sprint end, update items to `done`, write retro notes, plan next sprint
- **Carry-over**: Incomplete items return to backlog or carry into the next sprint

### Sprint Sizing

| Size | Effort | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| S | < 2 hours | Wire a single service to DB, add a test file |
| M | 2–6 hours | Build a complete view, implement a CLI command end-to-end |
| L | 1–2 days | Plugin loader with validation, keyboard navigation system |
| XL | 3–5 days | Sandbox implementation, storage abstraction layer |
