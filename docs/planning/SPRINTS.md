# Sprints

Two-week sprint cycles. Each sprint has a clear goal and pulls items from the [Backlog](BACKLOG.md).

## How Sprints Work

- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Planning**: Select items from backlog at sprint start, assign to sprint column in BACKLOG.md
- **Daily work**: Pick the next `ready` item, mark `in-progress`, complete it
- **Review**: At sprint end, update items to `done`, write retro notes, plan next sprint
- **Carry-over**: Incomplete items return to backlog or carry into the next sprint

### Sprint Sizing

| Size | Effort | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| S | < 2 hours | Wire a single service to DB, add a test file |
| M | 2–6 hours | Build a complete view, implement a CLI command end-to-end |
| L | 1–2 days | Plugin loader with validation, keyboard navigation system |
| XL | 3–5 days | Sandbox implementation, storage abstraction layer |

---

## Sprint 1 — "First Blood"

**Goal**: Wire the skeleton to a real database. Tasks can be created, listed, completed, and deleted through both the UI and CLI. The app actually works.

**Dates**: TBD (2 weeks)

| ID | Item | Size | Status |
|----|------|------|--------|
| D-03 | Generate initial migration from schema | S | pending |
| D-04 | CRUD query helpers (tasks, projects, tags, task_tags) | M | pending |
| C-01 | Wire TaskService to SQLite via Drizzle queries | M | pending |
| C-02 | Wire ProjectService to SQLite | S | pending |
| C-03 | Wire TagService to SQLite | S | pending |
| C-04 | Task creation with full field support | M | pending |
| C-05 | Task completion (mark done, set completedAt) | S | pending |
| C-06 | Task editing (title, priority, due, project, tags) | M | pending |
| C-07 | Task deletion | S | pending |
| C-08 | Task listing with filters | S | pending |
| C-09 | Due date queries (today, upcoming, overdue) | S | pending |
| C-10 | Priority sorting in queries | S | pending |
| U-06 | Wire Inbox view to live data | M | pending |
| U-07 | Wire Today view to live data | S | pending |
| U-08 | Wire Upcoming view to live data | S | pending |
| L-02 | `docket add` — wire to TaskService | S | pending |
| L-03 | `docket list` — wire to TaskService | S | pending |
| L-04 | `docket done` — wire to TaskService | S | pending |
| T-07 | Integration tests: TaskService + SQLite | M | pending |

**Capacity**: ~18 items (mostly S/M), fits a focused 2-week sprint.

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] `pnpm dev` → open browser → create a task via input → see it in the inbox
- [ ] Complete a task → it disappears from inbox
- [ ] Today view shows only tasks due today
- [ ] `pnpm cli add "task"` → `pnpm cli list` shows the task
- [ ] `pnpm cli done <id>` marks the task complete
- [ ] Integration tests pass: create → read → update → complete → delete
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes (lint + typecheck + test)

## Sprint 2 — "Feel Good"

**Goal**: The app feels polished. Keyboard navigation, command palette, theme switching, task editor, project views, recurring tasks. Users can actually use this day-to-day.

**Dates**: TBD (2 weeks, after Sprint 1)

| ID | Item | Size | Status |
|----|------|------|--------|
| C-11 | Recurring task creation on completion | M | pending |
| C-12 | Task search (full-text across title + description) | S | pending |
| U-09 | Project view with task list | M | pending |
| U-10 | Settings view: theme toggle | S | pending |
| U-12 | Task detail panel / editor | L | pending |
| U-13 | Keyboard navigation (j/k, enter, esc) | L | pending |
| U-14 | Command palette keybinding (Ctrl+K) | S | pending |
| U-15 | Light/dark theme switching | S | pending |
| P-06 | Parser inline preview (show parsed result as user types) | M | pending |
| L-05 | `docket edit` — wire to TaskService | S | pending |
| L-06 | `docket delete` — wire to TaskService | S | pending |
| L-07 | JSON output format (`--json`) | S | pending |
| T-08 | Integration tests: CLI commands | M | pending |
| T-09 | Component tests: TaskInput, TaskList | M | pending |

**Capacity**: ~14 items (mix of S/M/L), fits a 2-week sprint.

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] j/k navigates tasks, Enter opens editor, Esc closes
- [ ] Ctrl+K opens command palette with available commands
- [ ] Theme toggle switches between light and dark
- [ ] Completing a recurring task creates the next occurrence
- [ ] Task detail panel shows all fields and allows editing
- [ ] Project view filters to a single project
- [ ] CLI `edit` and `delete` commands work
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes

## Sprint 3 — "Plugins: Foundation"

**Goal**: Plugin loader works. Plugins can be discovered, validated, loaded, and unloaded. The event bus dispatches task lifecycle hooks. The example plugin actually runs.

**Dates**: TBD (2 weeks, after Sprint 2)

| ID | Item | Size | Status |
|----|------|------|--------|
| PL-16 | Event bus for task lifecycle hooks | M | pending |
| PL-04 | Plugin loader (discover + validate manifests) | L | pending |
| PL-05 | Plugin lifecycle (load/unload, call onLoad/onUnload) | L | pending |
| PL-06 | Plugin sandbox (restricted execution context) | XL | pending |
| PL-07 | Plugin API surface (task read/write, events) | L | pending |
| PL-17 | Plugin-specific isolated storage (persist to DB) | M | pending |
| T-10 | Plugin loader integration tests | M | pending |

**Capacity**: ~7 items but heavier (L/XL), fits a 2-week sprint.

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Drop a plugin folder into `plugins/` → Docket discovers it on startup
- [ ] Invalid manifests are rejected with clear error messages
- [ ] Plugin `onLoad()` and `onUnload()` are called correctly
- [ ] Plugins can register commands via the API
- [ ] Plugins receive `task:create` and `task:complete` events
- [ ] Plugin storage persists across app restarts
- [ ] Example plugin loads and shows task count in status bar
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes

## Sprint 4 — "Plugins: UI"

**Goal**: Plugins can extend the UI. Sidebar panels, custom views, status bar items, settings tabs, and the plugin store are all functional.

**Dates**: TBD (2 weeks, after Sprint 3)

| ID | Item | Size | Status |
|----|------|------|--------|
| PL-08 | Plugin UI extension: sidebar panels | L | pending |
| PL-09 | Plugin UI extension: custom views | L | pending |
| PL-10 | Plugin UI extension: status bar | M | pending |
| PL-11 | Plugin commands integration with command palette | M | pending |
| PL-12 | Plugin settings UI in Settings view | M | pending |
| PL-13 | Plugin store view (browse sources.json) | M | pending |
| PL-18 | Built-in Pomodoro plugin (fully functional) | L | pending |

**Capacity**: ~7 items (M/L), fits a 2-week sprint.

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Pomodoro plugin renders a sidebar panel with timer
- [ ] Plugin-registered views appear in sidebar navigation
- [ ] Status bar shows plugin-provided items
- [ ] Plugin commands appear in the command palette
- [ ] Plugin settings appear in Settings > Plugins
- [ ] Plugin store lists plugins from sources.json
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes
